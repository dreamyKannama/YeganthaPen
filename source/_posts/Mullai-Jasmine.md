Step 1: Collect a Reference Picture of your own or from a google search.

Step 2: Identify the parts of a flower

For Mullai, there are,
bloomed flower
Buds-full sized, mid-size, small size
Leaves
stem
Step 3: Define a circle or oval of irregular size which will represent an overall structure of a flower bunch.

Step 9: Fill the background with any visible color using color pencils or watercolor. Because jasmine looks in white color. Here, I'm using green and, yellow-colored pencils.

And here, the final colored version of the flower.
