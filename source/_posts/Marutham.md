Step 1: Collect a Reference Picture.I have taken Reference Pictures from https://www.slideshare.net/vairam99/99-tamil-flowers.


Step 2: Identify the parts of a flower


For Marutham, there are,

Fruits,
Buds-full sized,
mid-size,
small size,
Leaves.

Step 3: Draw a group of oval sizes that represents the bunch of fruits that the oval occupies.

Things to remember, when it was facing the front side, three sides will be visible.
When the fruits bunch turned upside down, over four sides will be visible.
Step 8: In the branches left out for buds and fruits, draw small fruits and buds. The below picture represents how to sketch a single bud, fruits.
