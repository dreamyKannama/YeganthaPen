I have taken Reference Pictures from https://www.slideshare.net/vairam99/99-tamil-flowers.

Step 2: Identify the parts of a flower

For Kurinji, there are,bloomed flowerBuds-full sized, mid-size, small sizeLeavesBuds with flowers

Step 3: Simplify the overall structure of a flower with basic shapes. Here, I have Identified the shapes such as oval as overall structure, small circles.
