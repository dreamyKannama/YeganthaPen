We Humans were Live under a time cycle of 24-hrs per day. 

Let us divide These 24-hours into 8 hours each, like three meals per day.

8-hours for Work / 8 hrs of study.
8-hours for Leisure.
8-hours for Sleeping.


The above approach will lead to an infinity lifeline, we, live longer, we humans while living we were not live for ourselves, we live in other people memories forever.

To make that infinity, lifeline the above approach may help you at a certain level, I guess.

Let Us see the Possibilities this approach may get failed and what are all effective ways to achieve this in each 8's.

# 8-hours for Work/study.

### Work or study within your threshold limits.

      We, Humans, invented and Discovered many things around us, only to ease up the works that we are doing on a day-to-day basis. Because we humans have limitations in our energy, stamina, mindset, etc., 



So, plan out things that you are sure of doing completely, prioritize and work. Don't take up things beyond your limits.



Share and Utilize the resources you have appropriately, whether it is a piece of knowledge, material, learning. Sharing with others will enable us to build the knowledge further stronger, and it saves time when we properly transfer our knowledge to others.

### Focus and Avoid Careless Mistakes

Okay. I defined the time as only 8 hours for Working/study. So, this is achievable only if you have dedicated effort and focus on the activity you do.

And, We are all surrounded by distractions, so eliminating the distraction will helps in focusing on the activity we do. With more concentration, dedication, and with proper planning, we can avoid most of the mistakes.



### Working on skillset

Improving our skillset requires consistent effort in learning, practicing, and up-to-date with the happenings in and around you will minimize the working effort time.



### Organize

Always Keep track of your activities and organize yourself. Maintain a checklist to keep track of yourself.



Make a note of all appreciation, Motivation, and support you got from others. It will help to improve ourselves.



# 8-hours for Leisure.

This part of the 8-hour is a time to spend time with hobbies, binge-watching, family, friends, exercise, sports, and whatever you like, most probably any of the two.

Spending time on your Leisure will increase productivity, you were relaxing, exploring. If we spend the appropriate time with our family and, friends most of the problem doesn't even raise.



# 8-hours for Sleeping.

An adequate amount of sleep is necessary to keep ourselves stable. Compromising sleep will lead to anxiety, mental illness, and many health problems.



Not Everyone is blessed to have this routine because many people need work more than the estimated time for their life survival in this world. So, if you have an opportunity to have this routine Kindly, take it up.



# Conclusion

When we like and work it only needs four days of working days for being productive.

If this 8-hour approach is not possible in the situations where,

someone is doing less work,

someone doing more work,

someone is always doing less work,

someone is always doing more work.



A Ruin in a family,

A Ruin in Your Interest,

A Ruin in a self-care,

Is A Ruin in a workplace,

Is A Ruin in a workplace,

Then it is a ruin in a LIFE.
