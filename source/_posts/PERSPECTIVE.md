Disclaimer: The Following content is only from my perspective. There is no assurance that if you follow, you can do it. ACT and REACT according to your situation, surrounding so that Things will work in an optimized way. It was self-learning from an average observer and listener ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è.  


Have you ever wondered whether Being educated and Being Skilled is the Same?

 The answer is NO from My perspective. Being Skilled is something entirely different from Being Educated. Only Being educated or exam marks won't make us Skilled unless we can coordinate with the real world and reality. 

Being Skilled Requires the following characteristics( from my perspective üòÄ)

CURIOUS 
A WANDER OF SEARCH AND RESEARCH 
DECISION-MAKING
APPLYING 
EXPERIMENTING 
SELF-VALIDATING
FEEDBACK 
# 1.CURIOUS 

Your Interest Matters! Without an interest, Curiosity does not exist. Be curious, but being curious like a kid or monkey is your choice. 

When a Kid was Curious, They THINK and ASK out of the box. They need answers with clarity when they see something and ask about something. Those Small Token of words will have an imminent impact on their Future. And The monkey will ask no questions but snatch the surrounding things. It won't worry about what it was, how it was, why it was. It directly tries to use them. 

# 2.A WANDER OF SEARCH AND RESEARCH 

Hey! we have Google to get the facts almost right. Despite that, search for various Possibilities come with your own idea. Try using Books, Online Courses, and newspapers to ensure the fact's originality. Read and Keep learning. 

# 3.DECISION MAKING 

And Here Comes the real challenge, Now You have gained knowledge from various sources. Not all the Content You Read is suitable for what you were Trying. 

The choice You make after learning should be new and innovative from your learning point of view. Prioritize your Choices and conclude with your decision.

# 4.APPLYING 

Let's Put the thought process you gained into action. You can apply by putting in your series of small efforts consistently and regularly. 

# 5.EXPERIMENTING 

There is always a various solution for a particular problem. Even Tough, we found a solution for a given problem statement, we should try with different possibilities until we get the optimized solution. 

# 6.SELF-VALIDATING

 Create an excepted output list and make a checklist before starting your activity. 

If it is a repeated activity you were doing daily, compare it with your yesterday effort and today. If it is better than yesterday, then Hooray for yourself! 

# 7.FEEDBACK 

" Even Homer Nods "üòâ

Usually, when we are doing things all by ourselves, We Won't be able to identify the mistakes by ourselves. It becomes critical to analyze and find the error. Get feedback and review with the appropriate person who has expertise already in the domain.
